Notes App

Features:

- Allows users to add notes with a title and description
- Allows users to view all notes in a table
- Allows users to select a note in the table and be taken to a detail view that contains more information about the note: Title, Description, Map indicating where the note was left off

- Included normal and retina icon
- Also allows users to update note while in detail view

Comments:

- Takes roughly 5 seconds before the app starts tracking the users current location. If you try to add a note before then, the lat/long will still be 0 since the user's location hasn't been tracked yet.
